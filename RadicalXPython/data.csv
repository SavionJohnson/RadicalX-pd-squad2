","I always love to plan ahead of my life, such as my career path. Since the first year of university, I’ve been looking for something to put my passion and experiences into one. I’ve always wanted my future job to be a combo of creativity, technical skills, and a platform for me to help people. J.R.R Tolkien said that even the smallest person can change the course of the future, and that's what I dreamed to do: to help people in their daily tasks and solve problems in the world. 

I realised that UXUI design is the perfect match. It incorporated my past experience, my university major, my goals, and most importantly, I am willing to learn more about it to ace any challenges that come with it. This is why I want to do more UXUI internships and launch my career in this direction, because I can see a clear path of continued studies, passion and stability.
